There are many ways to act responsibly as a researcher.
I think this is one of the many places where the 'boy scout rule' is applicable:
> Leave every place better than you found it.

In other words, when feeling overwhelmed by the challenge of doing *everything* right, just start with *something* and make it a little bit better.

Some things us **machine learning researchers** can do:
- _evaluate_ our models thoroughly to prevent exaggerated performance claims [[1]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222643/), [[2]](https://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(18)31081-3/fulltext), [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03395)
- follow the [TRIPOD guidelines](https://www.tripod-statement.org/resources/) when reporting on clinical risk prediction models, publish [model cards](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) or [datasheets for datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010)
- collaborate with domain experts and stakeholders to create ML systems that generate meaningful impact, instead of advancing 1% on a benchmark
- understand whether a problem really _requires_ (yet another) ML "solution"
- perform an _algorithmic impact assessment_ [[1]](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ada-Lovelace-Institute-DataKind-UK-Examining-the-Black-Box-Report-2020.pdf), [[2]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445935), [[3]](http://z-inspection.org/)
- assess the [climate impact of our ML projects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-0219-9), and support the [Climate Change AI Initiative](https://www.climatechange.ai/)
- engage critically in discussions regarding ethical usage of AI/ML


Some things **all researchers** can do:
- be kind to yourself, your students, and your colleagues, and nurture a supportive and encouraging workplace for everyone
- work towards meaningful progress on important challenges, instead of working towards that next paper as an end in itself
- contribute to the flourishing of your research community by reviewing, organizing events, teaching, supervising, mentoring, volunteering, doing public outreach work, ...
- make research _openly accessible_ (paper, code), _correct_, and _reproducible_ (if interested, see some very basic [best practices for scientific software development](https://github.com/e-pet/best-practices-scientific-software-dev/blob/master/best_practices_scientific_software_dev.md) that I wrote quite a while ago)
- aim for [design justice](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles) by giving those who will be affected by our research a voice in it
- support the [Scientists for future](https://scientists4future.org/) and, in particular, their [I won't do it under 1000km](https://unter1000.scientists4future.org/) initiative


Let me know if you think something crucial is missing that I should add!
