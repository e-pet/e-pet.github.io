**Hi there, I'm Eike.**

I am a Senior Scienstist working in Medical AI at [Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Medicine MEVIS](https://www.mevis.fraunhofer.de/) and a guest researcher at the radiology department of [Hannover Medical School (MHH)](https://www.mhh.de/en/).

In my research, I aim to contribute to the robustness, fairness, and overall trustworthiness of AI and machine learning models in medicine. This encompasses questions such as:
- [Do models perform equally well in different patient populations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594045) - and if not, [what is the underlying reason for this performance disparity](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-45249-9_14) and [how can we make models better](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(23)00145-9)?
- Are models truly diagnosing the health and disease of patients, or do they merely *appear* to do so - e.g., by [relying on shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12142)?
- Is it possible for models to be agnostic (invariant) to patient demographics - and [is this actually desirable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01397)?

While I mostly work in deep learning-based medical image analysis, my interests also span the broader medical domain, including, e.g., EHR and time series data.

I am also a co-organizer of the [FAIMI initiative for the fairness of AI in medical imaging](https://faimi.org/). We regularly organize workshops and other events - if you want to keep up to date with what we're doing, you should [sign up for our newsletter](https://faimi-workshop.github.io/newsletter/) or [join our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/faimiworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2zni1tswk-QnGfwJT5UlL21QXYHRKVvg)!

Finally, I am also involved in the AI Act's implementation in terms of harmonized technical standards. Specifically, I am contributing to the development of a technical standard on bias assessment and mitigation in [CEN/CENELEC JTC21](https://www.cencenelec.eu/areas-of-work/cen-cenelec-topics/artificial-intelligence/), first via [the Dutch NGO AlgorithmAudit](https://algorithmaudit.eu/) and now via [NoLeFa-84](https://nolefa.eu/what-we-do/).

- Started as a postdoc at DTU Compute with Aasa Feragen and Melanie Ganz (Sep '21)

**Previously**, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english), in the section for [Visual Computing](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/Research-sections/Visual-Computing).
Within the project [Bias and Fairness in Medicine](http://fairmed.compute.dtu.dk/), I (together with my amazing [collaborators](http://fairmed.compute.dtu.dk/team.php)) worked on [the fairness of *risk score models* in medicine](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3593013.3594045).

**Pre-Previously**, I worked at the [University of L체beck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/en/university/university.html), in the [Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine](https://www.ime.uni-luebeck.de/institute.html). 
In a project executed together with the research unit of [Dr채ger Medical](https://www.draeger.com/en-us_us/Home), we worked hard to bring *surface electromyographic monitoring of respiratory effort* into clinical practice for improving mechanical ventilation.
My research in this context spanned mathematical modeling, signal processing, parameter identification & statistical inference, all related to either surface electromyographic measurements, respiration, or both.
See my previous [publications](publications.md) for some of the work we did.
