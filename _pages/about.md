**Hi, I'm Eike.**

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [DTU Compute](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english), in the section for [Visual Computing](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/Research-sections/Visual-Computing).
In my current research within the project [Bias and Fairness in Medicine](http://fairmed.compute.dtu.dk/), I (together with my awesome collaborators!) attempt to answer the following questions: 

What does it mean for a data-driven health risk score model to be "fair"? How can we test whether a model *is* fair, and how can we *design* such a model?
{: .notice}

Let me elaborate just a tiny bit: health risk score models are likely to be used for resource prioritization in the healthcare system, for example by influencing who gets access to acute care and who does not. As these are decisions that influence human livelihoods, we - as a society - would obviously want these decisions to be made "fairly". But what does that even mean? Should men and women (on average) get an identical amount of extra care? What if a disease has a higher prevalence in a certain group? What if certain groups are especially affected by a disease, but it is impossible to identify this group based on available data? What if the data that are available are *biased* due to (historical or present-day) societal biases, such as poor patients having worse access to medical treatment than rich patients?
Once the *philosophical* question of which fairness definition to pursue is answered, various *technical* questions arise: how can the fairness of a model be quantified, and how can we actively *build* a model that is fair in the chosen sense? 

**Previously**, I worked at the [University of Lübeck](https://www.uni-luebeck.de/en/university/university.html), in the [Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine](https://www.ime.uni-luebeck.de/institute.html). 
In a project executed together with the research unit of [Dräger Medical](https://www.draeger.com/en-us_us/Home), we worked hard to bring surface electromyographic monitoring of respiratory effort into clinical practice for improving mechanical ventilation.
My research in this context spanned mathematical modeling, signal processing, parameter identification & statistical inference, all related to either surface electromyographic measurements, respiration, or both.
See my previous [publications](publications.md) for some of the work we did.
